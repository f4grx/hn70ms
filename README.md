70cm mobile station
===================

This project is about making a 70cm FSK mobile device, eg a phone, that can use
a 430-440 MHz FSK radio to communicate, using codec2.

The board has:

 * an OLED screen
 * a keyboard and joystick (with backlight)
 * a 430 MHz radio module
 * a SIM5300 3G modem (optional)
 * a NEO-M8N GPS
 * a STM32 CPU running NuttX
 * a lipo battery with usb charging circuit

For the moment only the schematic is ready.
